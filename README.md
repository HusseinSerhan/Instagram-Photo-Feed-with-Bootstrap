# Instagram Clone with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5

Welcome to my Instagram clone project! This is a simple clone of Instagram's photo feed page, built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. The goal of this project was to practice my front-end development skills and learn how to use Bootstrap 5 components.

## Getting Started

## Bootstrap 5 Components Used

This project uses the following components from Bootstrap 5:

- The grid with three images by row: This is used to display multiple photos in a row on the photo feed page.
- The grid with one image by row: This is used to display individual photos on the photo feed page.
- The modal: This is used to display a form by clicking on "create a new post" button.
- The dropdown: This is used in the header to display a dropdown menu with options.
